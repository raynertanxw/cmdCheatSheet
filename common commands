gcc on Windows
##############
To compile using gcc WITH compiler warnings, use the '-Wall' option.
To compile to a specific name, use '-o <file name>', otherwise the compiled program will be named 'a.out'
gcc -Wall <filename.c> -o <desired filename>

To compile using gcc into an object file, use the '-c' flag. This produces files "<filename>.o"
Note: There is no need to use '-o' to specify file name when compiling to object files as it will automatically take the source file name.
gcc -Wall -c <filename.c>

To link files together, simply list them. No need for the '-Wall' option as object files have already been compiled successfully.
gcc <file1.o> <file2.o> -o <desired filename>

To link with libraries, use the '-lNAME' flag, where NAME is the same from 'libNAME.a'
gcc -Wall <filename.c> -lNAME -o <desired filename>
